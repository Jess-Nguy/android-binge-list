This is my final project for my android studio course from Mohawk. This uses http://www.omdbapi.com/ and it stores your favourite and reviews of movies.

Run this on Android studio.

Device tested on:

- `Pixel 2 API 23` 
- Resolution: `1080 x 1920: 420dpi`
- Target: `Android 6.0 (Google APIs)`
- CPU/ABI: `x86_64`
